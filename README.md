## Where to download a compiled version?

You can get the latest compiled version [here.](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/Shelly7w7/GlobalMute)

### How to install?

After downloading the compiled version from poggit, simply put the file in your server directory (``/plugins``)

### Permission(s)?

There are currently two permissions.

Permission to use the command: ``global.mute``.

Permission to chat even if global mute is toggled on: ``global.mute.chat``.

### How does this work?

Type ``/globalmute on/off`` to toggle it on/off. After the global mute is toggled on, only the players with permission ``global.mute.chat`` can chat otherwise everyone else have to wait till it's toggled off.
